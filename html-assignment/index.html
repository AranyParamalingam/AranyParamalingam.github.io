                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Arany Paramalingam and I am from Toronto. My interests include music and visual arts. Some of the music I listen to are J-rock, K-rap, British rap, Polish <abbr title="Electronic Dance Music">EDM</abbr>, and Soca. I tend to listen to music I don't understand, because I feel like the lyrics get in the way of my enjoyment of the music. I love art and looking at many art pieces from varies artists online. My favorite art movements are <em>Surrealism</em> and <em>Realism.</em></p>
                <p>Past my interests, I am currently attending the <em>Interactive Media and Design</em> course at Algonquin College. I decided to take this course due to its variety. I honestly didn't know what career I wanted to pursue in, I new the general area but not the job title. So far I believe I want to be a UX designer or a web developer, but I feel I will only find out what I really want to do at the end of my study. Overall, I hope I enjoy my time here in this class and course!</p>
